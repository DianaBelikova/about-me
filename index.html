            <h3>Why did I choose a wed-developer path in IT?</h3>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Since the very beginning of my studies in BSUIR I was not sure I would connect my future with IT sphere, mainly because I was not very well informed and weren't simply interested in particular type of career option. People all over me were slowly following
                    their ideas of becoming someone like a web-designer or game developer, while I wasn't even looking at that side of the road.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just a year ago I was in Minsk talking to my friend about how it is to finally make a choice of what you want to do in such a wide world as IT programming. She told me that it's not that hard to choose what you want to do ones you explore the whole internet
                    and also ask your friends or friends of their friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <q>Once you do that try to make a list of what really made you feel
              like it's a good option, better than the rest and start with
              it.</q
            >- She said.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, yeah, that's pretty much how I started scrolling down the web
            when I found the "future courses" web-site,
